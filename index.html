		Towards the end of December 2019, authorities in Wuhan, Hubei province,
		announced a cluster of cases of pneumonia associated with the Huanan /
		South China Seafood Wholesale Market, for which a cause had not yet been
		identified. <b>On 8 January, a new coronavirus "2019-novel coronavirus
		(2019-nCoV)" was identified</b> as the cause of the illness. Majority of
		the
		confirmed cases are in Wuhan, with several exported cases in other areas
		of China, and into other countries. Transmission may be occurring from
		animal/environment to people and <b>human-to-human transmission has been
		confirmed.</b> (Source <a

	<h2>Symptoms</h2>

	<div>
		Patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection have reportedly had mild to
		severe respiratory illness with symptoms of:
		<ul>
			<li>fever</li>
			<li>cough</li>
			<li>shortness of breath</li>
		</ul>
		CDC believes at this time that symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear in as
		few as 2 days or as long as 14 after exposure. This is based on what has
		been seen previously as the incubation period of <a
			href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/index.html"
			target="_blank">MERS</a> viruses. (Source

	<h2>Prevention</h2>

	<div>
		There is currently no vaccine to prevent 2019-nCoV infection. The best
		way to prevent infection is to avoid being exposed to this virus. Right
		now, 2019-nCoV has not been found to be spreading in the United States,
		so there are no additional precautions recommended for the general
		public to take. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday
		preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses,
		including:
		<ul>
			<li>Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20
				seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an
				alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
			</li>
			<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
			</li>
			<li>Avoid close contact with people who are sick.</li>
			<li>Stay home when you are sick.</li>
			<li>Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue
				in the trash.
			</li>
			<li>Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
			</li>
		</ul>
		These are every day habits that can help prevent the spread of several
		viruses. CDC does have <a
